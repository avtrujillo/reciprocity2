Getting connections to populate a privacy group
Auth through devise - which should allow us to query Facebook API
Possibly extend to being able to import friends lists (and groups)

Plan is to pull all the data in when user authenticates

This might cover what we need - it looks like the gist of it is you pick which info fields you want facebook to give you access to, and the user
will be asked if they give permission to expose those fields.

People keep bringing up Koala though, and I note that the oauth2 thing doesn't seem to cover _actually getting a friend's list_

All right!  So, setting up Facebook asks for your frembs - literally one line, just add scope="user_friends" to the devise thing

Actually using frembs - well, that's what Koala is for - there's a facebook model that has methods get_object and get_connections, get_connections gives
us the power of frembs
