When you log into reciprocity.io or interact with the app you should assume
that we store everything you do. If you authenticate with external apps like Facebook, we use their APIs to get relevant info like your
photo, email address, and list of friends who use reciprocity.  The data is
used to implement the app (e.g. to send notifications to you and to people
with whom you match) and to calculate anonymized statistics like total number
of users and total number of matches.  If you destroy your account we will try
to immediately remove all of the interesting data about you, but we won't be
able to remove you from all of the log files etc.; for all we know that stuff
will stick around indefinitely.

All of that data is stored unencrypted in our database (except for passwords which are hashed), so we could look at it
if we wanted to (as of July 1, 2019 only Stardust has credentials to access the database or deploy code to reciprocity.io. This policy will be updated if/when that changes). We promise not to look at your data without specific permission (e.g. if you report a bug, we may ask for permission to look at your data to help with debugging).  We try to be
basically sensible about security, but probably a sufficiently determined
attacker could somehow get the data.

We use cookies to keep track of the fact that you are logged in.
